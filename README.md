## Project Structure

```
/apps/desktop/
  /main         # Electron main process

  /renderer     # React frontend (Vite)
/packages/shared  # Shared types and utilities
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm 9+

## Installation

```bash

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + O` | Open Workspace Folder |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + P` | Command Palette |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + W` | Close Current Tab |

## Architecture

### IPC Communication

The renderer process never directly accesses the filesystem. All file operations go through IPC:

- `selectWorkspace()` - Opens folder picker dialog
- `readDir(path)` - Lists directory contents
- `readFile(path)` - Reads file content
- `stat(path)` - Gets file/directory stats

### State Management

Uses Zustand for lightweight state management:
- Workspace path and tree
- Open tabs and active tab
- File contents cache
- View states for Monaco editor

### Security

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- All filesystem access through preload scripts
